# autiereads-web-app
This is an MVP project created by me for a Full Stack Development Course.
It is a directory of books and articles about autism born out of the labor of the autistic community and allies.
The main objective of the project it is to contribute to educate society within the neurodiversity paradigm, beyond the medical pathologization of autism.
